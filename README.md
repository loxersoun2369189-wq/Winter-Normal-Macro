## Recent Update — 1.2

### Before You Update
Save any values you changed into a notepad so you can paste them back after updating.  
A lot of this will move into a `.json` file next patch so you won’t have to do this anymore.

### Beta Features
- **Disconnect checker + auto‑reconnector**  
  Just clicks the Roblox *Reconnect* button. Not messing with launch args for now.

### Changes
- Added a **sanity check** in `secure_placement` in case lag and erza's pop up bricks the macro  
- Improved **final lane buyer** so it still buys lanes even if your camera breaks  
- Increased **purchase detect tolerance** from 20 → 40  
- Made `pydirectinput` press **backslash** instead of using `keyboard` (may fix the random “/” issue)

## Common Fixes

Mega downloads can corrupt files, breaking **Python** or **Tesseract**.

### Tesseract Issues
If text detection stops working:
- Re‑download and unzip again, or  
- Install clean Tesseract:  
  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.5.0  
- Clear the old folder first  
- Optional: add the **Tesseract directory** (not the exe) to PATH

### Python Issues
If Python errors or packages are missing:
- Install Python **3.13.11**  
- Install required packages:

If you want, I can also reorganize the whole README into a cleaner layout with consistent headers and a proper changelog section.
